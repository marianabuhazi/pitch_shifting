# Pitch Shifting Algorithms
## Overview
This repository includes a MATLAB version of the algorithms used in our Embedded System Design final project, No Caller ID for Spring 2023 at Columbia University. 
The pitch-shifting algorithms used in our project are inspired by [PitchShifter by jmt329](https://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/ece5760/FinalProjects/s2017/jmt329_swc63_gzm3/jmt329_swc63_gzm3/PitchShifter/index.html).

pitch_shifter.m includes the pitch-shifting algorithm, meanwhile, pitch_shifter_test.m mimicks the procedure of reading 24-bit samples from the bus, running the algorithm on each sample, and visualizing the shifted waveform.
